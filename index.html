            <p> Badminton is an indoor game that is played with a lightweight racket and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock was a small cork with a hemisphere with 16 geese that was attached and weighing about 5 grams. So, these types of the shuttle may still be useful nowadays. But the shuttles generally used are made from synthetic materials are also allowed by BWF which is a short name for a badminton world federation. So, the essay on my favorite game badminton is an insight into my favorite game and the rules and regulations followed around the world. We all love to play badminton.Only two people are required to play badminton, or only two people can easily play badminton.In every school, there is a sports period in which teachers make students play badminton and tell them the benefits of playing badminton.PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, P Gopichand, Srikanth Kidambi, P Kashyap are the top best players of Badminton in India </p>
